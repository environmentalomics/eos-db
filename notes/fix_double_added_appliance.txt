In the current data model, each Appliance (VM) can have any number
of owners.  But when using eos-admin to try and add a new oner (Soon) to a VM
(bl8eos1) I ended up making a new bl8eos1
and making Soon the owner of it.  Subtle, and normally it wouldn't matter but
in this case I want shared ownership.  So a a little database hacking is in
order.

So - on Garudimimus:

$ sudo -u eos-db psql -d eos_db

=> select * from artifact;
   #id=25 is the new record.  id=1 is the old record.
=> select * from ownership join resource on resource.id = ownership.id join
touch on resource.touch_id = touch.id join "user" on ownership.user_id =
"user".id;
   #Touch 2580 relating to ownership 1066 associated hyugwe with VM 25.
=> select * from touch where id = 2580;
   #Confirms this ownership is attached to artifact 25

So, even though this is an update-free schema I should be able to:

1) Update touch 2580 to relate to artifact 1
2) Remove appliance 25
3) Remove artifact 25

UPDATE touch SET artifact_id=1 WHERE id=2580;
DELETE FROM appliance WHERE id=25;
DELETE FROM artifact WHERE id=25;
